# Wpp-Script
Simple script, that with the help of `selenium` library, navigates `<HTML body>` of Whatsapp Web to send messages **N** times to specific target or group. 

## Features
- The code iterate in a `While loop` - so as a flag finishes it, there is no need to re-scan QR code every time you want to send a             message to a different Target or Group (this is only in the case that you did not re-run the code)
